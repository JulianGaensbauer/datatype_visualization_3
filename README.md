## Project description

This project has been developed in the context of my bachelor thesis. The goal is to find a fitting form of visualization for contextual information in the field of automotive digital forensics. The application should serve as a sort of guide, to make it easier to find out where relevant data for an incident can be extracted from. 
The focus solely lies on the visualization and no other functionality is planned up to now. 

## Project setup

Please follow the steps below to get a local version of this application up and running:

1. install node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. downgrade version of node with `npm install -g node@14.16.0`
3. run `npm install -g yarn`
4. run `npm install -g @vue/cli`
5. navigate to the project folder
6. run `yarn add .\package.json`
7. navigate into the project folder
8. run `yarn serve`
9. open localhost:8080 in your browser and click on "Home"

## Application testing

1. test the application by clicking around for a bit
2. fill out the user experience questionnaire provided [here](https://github.com/JulianGaensbauer/datatype_visualization_3/tree/master/Questionnaire)

## Testing the other form of visualization made in Adobe Xd

1. the click prototype with the second form of visualization can be found [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/07e0e2ef-ee36-4742-8791-a904592eecc7-52b3/?fullscreen&hints=off) 
2. test the prototype by clicking around
3. fill out a second questionnaire again found [here](https://github.com/JulianGaensbauer/datatype_visualization_3/tree/master/Questionnaire), it is the same questionnaire but this time for the click prototype

## Feedback
