# Project description

This project has been developed in the context of my bachelor thesis. The goal is to find a fitting form of visualization for contextual information in the field of automotive digital forensics. The application should explore forms of data visualization that guide the user's attention to important elements on the current page. Through directing the focus, the user is leaded from element to element and in the end discovers the information they were searching for.
The focus solely lies on the visualization and no other functionality is planned up to now.

## How to work with the framwork?

1. Go through the [setup of the project provided below](#project-setup)
2. Play with the [vue project](#vue-project) (this repo) and fill out the [questionnaire](https://github.com/JulianGaensbauer/datatype_visualization_3/tree/master/Questionnaire)
3. Play with the [Adobe Xd project](#adobe-xd-project) and fill out the [questionnaire](https://github.com/JulianGaensbauer/datatype_visualization_3/tree/master/Questionnaire)

## Project setup

Please follow the steps below to get a local version of this application up and running:

1. Install node.js the LTS version 16.13.1 [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run `npm install -g yarn` to install the current version of yarn
3. Run `npm install -g @vue/cli` to install the current version of vue's cli
4. Clone this repository and navigate to the cloned folder
5. Run `yarn add .\package.json` on Windows or `yarn add package.json` on Linux to add all package requirements
6. Run `yarn serve` to start the server
7. Open [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) in your browser

## Vue project

1. An example test scenario would be: You want to know what data components would contain relevant data to clarify the question of guilt in an accident. Try to find out by using the application.
2. Test the application further by clicking around for a bit
3. Fill out the user experience questionnaire provided [questionnaire](https://github.com/JulianGaensbauer/datatype_visualization_3/tree/master/Questionnaire)

## Adobe Xd project

1. The click prototype with the second form of visualization can be found [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/07e0e2ef-ee36-4742-8791-a904592eecc7-52b3/?fullscreen&hints=off)
2. Try testing the same scenario as before: You want to know what data components would contain relevant data to clarify the question of guilt in an accident. Try to find out by using the application.
3. Test the prototype further by clicking around
4. Fill out a second questionnaire again found [questionnaire](https://github.com/JulianGaensbauer/datatype_visualization_3/tree/master/Questionnaire), it is the same questionnaire but this time for the click prototype
