## Project description

This project has been developed in the context of my bachelor thesis. The goal is to find a fitting form of visualization for contextual information in the field of automotive digital forensics. The application should explore forms of data visualization that guide the user's attention to important elements on the current page. Through directing the focus, the user is leaded from element to element and in the end discovers the information they were searching for. 
The focus solely lies on the visualization and no other functionality is planned up to now. 

## Project setup

Please follow the steps below to get a local version of this application up and running:

1. install node.js the LTS version 16.13.1 https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. run `npm install -g yarn`
3. run `npm install -g @vue/cli`
4. use your console of choice and navigate to the project folder you downloaded from this repository
5. run `yarn add .\package.json` on Windows or `yarn add package.json` on Linux
6. run `yarn serve`
7. open localhost:8080 in your browser and click on "Home"

## Application testing

1. an example test scenario would be: You want to know what data components would contain relevant data to clarify the question of guilt in an accident. Try to find out by using the application.
2. test the application further by clicking around for a bit
3. fill out the user experience questionnaire provided [here](https://github.com/JulianGaensbauer/datatype_visualization_3/tree/master/Questionnaire)

## Testing the other form of visualization made in Adobe Xd

1. the click prototype with the second form of visualization can be found [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/07e0e2ef-ee36-4742-8791-a904592eecc7-52b3/?fullscreen&hints=off) 
2. try testing the same scenario as before: You want to know what data components would contain relevant data to clarify the question of guilt in an accident. Try to find out by using the application.
3. test the prototype further by clicking around
4. fill out a second questionnaire again found [here](https://github.com/JulianGaensbauer/datatype_visualization_3/tree/master/Questionnaire), it is the same questionnaire but this time for the click prototype
